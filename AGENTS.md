# sherifiq-website

React + Vite + Tailwind CSS project for Sherifiq.

## Development Server

A Vite development server is **always running** on `$PORT` (default 8443). You don't need to start it manually.

- Preview URL: The user can access the running app through the preview panel
- Hot reload: Changes to source files are reflected immediately

## Key Files

- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component
- `src/main.tsx` - React entry point
- `src/index.css` - Global styles and Tailwind CSS import
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration
- `.mise.toml` - Toolchain versions (Node.js, pnpm)

## Styling

This project uses **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling. Use Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX. Tailwind is loaded via the Vite plugin — no PostCSS config needed.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
